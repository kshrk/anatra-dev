# ANATRA 1.0.2

[Manual (English)](./docs/anatra_manual_en.pdf)  
[Manual (Japanese)](./docs/anatra_manual_jpn.pdf)

**ANATRA** (*Ana*lyze *Tra*jectories) is a collection of Tcl/Fortran90 programs for analyzing trajectories obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

We often need to analyze specific atoms, molecules, or amino acid residues of proteins in a system. However, writing a general-purpose program to extract such specific parts is not an easy task. This is because it is necessary to extract atom groups that satisfy multiple complex conditions simultaneously, such as:

> "residues numbered from 11 to 50, with residue name ALA, and only heavy atoms."

Creating a program that can interpret and extract such sets defined by intersections and unions of multiple conditions can be quite difficult.

On the other hand, **VMD** (*Visual Molecular Dynamics*), a tool widely used by MD users around the world, offers an excellent feature called **Atomselection** for selecting specific parts of a system. For instance, the above condition can be expressed in VMD's Atomselection syntax as:

```
resid 11 to 50 and resname ALA and noh
```

which is easy to understand intuitively.

**ANATRA** adopts a design that leverages VMD's Atomselection feature. As a result, users can use exactly the same syntax as in Atomselection for selecting specific parts of the system, eliminating the need to learn a new selection language—especially convenient for existing VMD users.

**ANATRA** consists of numerous Tcl/Fortran programs tailored to different types of analyses. To manage these programs in a unified way, a command-line interface named `"anatra"` is provided. Users can perform various analyses by executing:

```
$ anatra analysis_mode -option1 -option2 ...
```

In this workflow, the corresponding Tcl script is executed on VMD according to the specified analysis mode, utilizing Atomselection to identify the region of interest. The selected information is then passed as input to a Fortran program for analysis. All of this is handled internally, and users do not need to be aware of the intermediate steps—everything runs in a streamlined manner.
At the same time, since the Fortran programs themselves do not implement Atomselection directly, the source code remains simpler and easier to maintain. This also allows users to create new analysis programs with ease by building upon the libraries provided by **ANATRA**.
